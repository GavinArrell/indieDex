The company has revealed that 25 indie titles are lined up for release on Xbox One, courtesy of the Id@Xbox programme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the games are several well-known projects from highly respected developers. Toronoto-based studio Capybara is bringing across Super Time Force, its innovative time-twisting platformer originally cited for Xbox 360, while Q.U.B.E. Directorâ€™s Cut from Toxic Games updates the award-winning first-person PC puzzler. Elsewhere 1001 Spikes is a hardcore side-scroller from Nicalis, perhaps best known for collaborating on cult hit, VVVVVV, and CastleStorm from Zen Studios is a mash-up of Tower Defense title and physics destruction sim. The beautiful Zelda tribute Hyper Light Drifter, previously earmarked for PS4 and Vita, is also coming across. \r\n<br><br>\r\nâ€œSince we first announced the program in August, weâ€™ve been working closely with developers to bring a diverse array of independent games to Xbox One,â€ said ID@Xbox games director, Chris Charla. â€œOur goal is to make the process as easy as possible so developers can focus on what matters most: creating the games youâ€™re beginning to see today.â€\r\n<br><br>\r\nTwo of the 25 titles have been designed specifically to explore the capabilities of the Xbox One hardware. It Draws a Red Box by Other Ocean is a social eight-player Bomberman tribute, and FRU by Through Games is a Kinect-based puzzler.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMicrosoft was originally criticised for disallowing self-publishing on Xbox One which appeared to put the platform out of reach for many small studios without publishers. However, the company later announced that self-publishing would be supported and that every consumer Xbox One unit would be able to function as a development machine. \r\n<br><br>\r\nâ€œOur goal has always been to make Xbox One the best place to play games, and that means having a diverse portfolio for gamers to choose from,â€ said Phil Spencer, corporate vice president of Microsoft Studios. â€œWeâ€™ve worked closely with independent developers to bring their own brand of creativity and innovation to the platform and today is just the beginning.â€\r\n<br><br>\r\nHowever, Sony has also been courting the indie sector, securing exclusives such as The Witness and featuring smaller studios heavily in its press conferences at E3 and Gamescom. The companyâ€™s decision to unveil its virtual reality hardware at GDC rather than a major marketing event like E3 has been seen as an attempt to accentuate its close relationship with the development community.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhatever the case, the console manufacturers have learned from crossover hits like Minecraft and Hotline Miami that offbeat, often surreal, titles have a large fanbase online. Digital games services like Steam and Xbox Live Arcade have made idiosyncratic titles available to a global audience, and the scene is flourishing. Furthermore, cult studios like Vlambeer and Mojang have large communities that console makers hope can be mobilised toward their hardware. In the battle for influence and kudos, securing a range of indie hits is becoming as important as the multimillion dollar deals to grab Triple A blockbusters.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe other titles announced so far are Calibre 10 Racing Series by Bongfish GmbH, Chariot by Frima, Chuckâ€™s Challenge 3D by Niffler, Contrast by Compulsion Games, Divekick Addition Edition + by Iron Galaxy Studios, Forced by BetaDwarf ApS, Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition by DrinkBox Studios and Gunscape by Blowfish Studios. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are as yet no firm release details, although itâ€™s likely some of these titles will be available via the Xbox One version of Microsoftâ€™s Games With Gold feature, which â€“ like PlayStation Plus â€“ will provide free titles to subscribers when launched. </p></br><p>Article by <a href="profile.php?user=Liam">Liam</a> on 23/03/2014 at 18:49</p></div><p class="readMore">Read More</p></div>', 0, '2014-03-23 18:49:06', 0, 0, ';xboxone;;xbox360;', ';action;;adventure;;music;;mmo;;puzzle;;rpg;;shooter;;sport;', 'beta', 3, '0.00', 0),

Whether your aim is to create a monumental metropolis with hundreds of buildings and skyscrapers, or , alternatively, just to create your very own farm with an unlimited chicken supply, minecraft will let you do it.</p><br><p>Minecraft is a virtual world made entirely of blocks. This simple, but genius, idea allows creativity to flow effortlessly. The user can opt to build with different materials, dig for resources, and explore. But most importantly, the user must survive. They are tasked with keeping their hunger meter fully replenished in order to stay at full health and during the day can easily find chickens, cows, or pigs for food. But in the darkness, evil lurks. At nightfall and in dark caves the user must protect themselves by any means necessary against, zombies, spiders, and creepers. Creepers are most feared of all but i wouldnt want to spoil it for you.

What makes Fez stand out, however, is all the little things that are not directly obvious. There is an almost intimidating and uncountable amount of content that is hidden, secret or written in non-existent language. Fez presents itself through amazing art and animation, music and a careful tendency towards being a calm & peaceful place with a darker undertone. The lack of combat might make Fez feel somewhat slow or uninteresting to some that are more pre-disposed towards Call of Duty or more action-oriented games, but to me Fez stands out as the first real adventure game in a decade. It is a game I want to play without walkthrough or spoilers simply because it so subtly challenges me to figure it out myself through its elaborate world and fiction.</p><p>Fez appeals to me in the nostalgic craving for a proper adventure game, yet stands out because it goes beyond just being a nostalgic throwback. Fez is not scared to radically overthrow some notions about what games should be while being a truly interesting game first and foremost at all times.</p><p>Fez is something remarkably special.</p><iframe width="1280" height="720" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0-LMU5T5vk8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></br><p class="clear">Review by <a href="profile.php?user=andrew">andrew</a> on 23/03/2014 at 20:53</p></div><p class="readMore">Read More</p></div>', 0, '2014-03-23 20:53:03', 0, 0, ';pc;;mac;;linux;;ps4;;ps3;;xbox360;', ';puzzle;', '2012', 4, '10.00', 0);
